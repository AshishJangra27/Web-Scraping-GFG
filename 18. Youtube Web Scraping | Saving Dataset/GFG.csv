Bi-Wizard School Coding Contest | GeeksforGeeks School,Premiered on 20 Jan 2022,83,"2,402 views",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5EHtZRa5w0,"Coding is the most in-demand and upcoming skill of the industry and it will continue to grow as the years pass. Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!

How to Convert Any Python File to .exe? | GeeksforGeeks,23 Jul 2021,102,"3,949 views",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32sHvb4oigk,"In this video, we're going to discuss how to convert a Python (.py) file to a .exe file. When you convert a Python file to a .exe file, it basically allows the other individuals to run your Python script without actually installing Python on their respective systems. Here, we'll see two ways to do this particular thing - one is via using the pyinstaller library and another is via using auto-py-to-exe library. So, let's get started now.

Handling Missing Values in Pandas Dataframe | GeeksforGeeks,20 May 2021,316,"13,777 views",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDr67HBIPz8,"In this video, we're going to discuss how to handle missing values in Pandas. In Pandas DataFrame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was not collected or it never existed. And as we can't provide null values to our Machine Learning model, we need to handle them properly. Now, let's get started. 

00:00 Let's Start
01:44 Checking for Missing Values using isnull()
03:31 Filling Null Values Using fillna()
05:35 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'pad')
07:05 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'bfill')
11:41 Filling Null Values with the Mean, Max or Min of a Column
13:38 Dropping Null Values Using dropna()
16:12 Filling Null Values Using replace()
18:47 Filling Null Values Using interpolate()
